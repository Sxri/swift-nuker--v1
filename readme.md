# SWIFT NUKER v.1.0

## Details:
A very simple DiscordBot server nuker in discord.py

Contains no credit spamming besides a few things, meaing, it will not spam "SWIFTNUKER", it is fully custom, so you can pick the text and phrases you want.

## Commands:

 - Here is a list of current available v1.0 commands:

`.spamchan <channel_name>` (spams the channel name you provided after the command, ex: ".spamchan swift-nuker"
`.deletechan` (deletes all available channels & categories)
`.rankme` (ranks the discord id for your account, you provided at the beginning)
`.nickall <nickname>` (sets the specified nickname to all members online) [Bugs May Occur] 
`.banall` (bans all members in the server) [VERY BUGGY, I've tried multiple times to fix it but it doesn't work, if anyone can assist me, my discord is open! swift#8856]
`.kickall` (kicks all members in the server) [Also very buggy]
`.dmall <phrase>` (DM's all members in the server the specified phrase) [I have no clue if this even works btw]
`.namechange <word1> <word2> <word>` (changes discord server name to each word seperated by spaces)
`.stopnamechange` (stops the server name change loop)
`.sayall <phrase>` (says the specified phrase in all channels)
`.sayallstop` (stops spamming the phrase in all channels)
